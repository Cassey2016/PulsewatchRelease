# Testing comparison (re-trained) model(s)

## For conference paper published on ICASSP 2025:

In the folder `testcomparison`:

1. Run `testcomparison/main_test_Liu_model_PPG_only.ipynb` for testing re-trained 1D VGG-16 model with one channel of input (**PPG only**).

   - It will call the code `testcomparison/run_test_Liu_model_PPG_only.py`.

## For journal paper published on unknown:

Model 1, `1D-VGG-16 (PPG only)`: testcomparison/main_test_Liu_model_PPG_only.ipynb

Model 2, `1D-VGG-16 (four channels)`: testcomparison/main_test_Liu_model_four_channels.ipynb

Model 3, `2D DenseNet (2D TFS)`: will contact 2D DenseNet paper author to upload it.
